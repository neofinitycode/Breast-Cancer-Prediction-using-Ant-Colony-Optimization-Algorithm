# Breast Cancer Prediction using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm

This project is based on the following research paper: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1027744">Data mining with an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm</a>

The dataset used for the same is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data provided by UCI

In this project, I set out to recreate and expand upon Ant Miner, the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) for data classification originally proposed in the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1027744">research paper</a>. Specifically, they propose a method of using an ACA in order to discover rules that best discriminate between different classes present in a dataset based on measurable attributes.
